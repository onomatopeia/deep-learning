    "Now that we have a basic understanding of how SageMaker works we will try to use it to construct a complete project from end to end. Our goal will be to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.\n",

    "\n",
    "Some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this notebook. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with '**TODO**' in the header indicate that you need to complete or implement some portion within them. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `# TODO: ...` comment. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to implementing code, there will be questions for you to answer which relate to the task and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a '**Question:**' header. Carefully read each question and provide your answer below the '**Answer:**' header by editing the Markdown cell.\n",

    "2. Process / Prepare the data.\n",

    "For this project, you will be following the steps in the general outline with some modifications. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will not be testing the model in its own step. You will still be testing the model, however, you will do it by deploying your model and then using the deployed model by sending the test data to it. One of the reasons for doing this is so that you can make sure that your deployed model is working correctly before moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will deploy and use your trained model a second time. In the second iteration you will customize the way that your trained model is deployed by including some of your own code. In addition, your newly deployed model will be used in the sentiment analysis web app."

One might 'like' or not 'like' a film, also one might have the best 'time' or the worst 'time' of their life. Summarizing, these words are likely to be in a review but also they do not convey any information about a spectator's sentiment. "

Potentially that might deteriorate the performance of our network.\n",

However, the above violin plot suggests that maybe we don't need to use 500 characters for padding and a smaller length might be enough to capture the great majority (e.g. 300). "

Currently our model takes input of the form `review_length, review[500]` where `review[500]` is a sequence of `500` integers which describe the words present in the review, encoded using `word_dict`. Fortunately for us, SageMaker provides built-in inference code for models with simple inputs such as this.\n",

This function must be called `model_fn()` and takes as its only parameter a path to the directory where the model artifacts are stored. This function must also be present in the python file which we specified as the entry point. In our case the model loading function has been provided and so no changes need to be made.\n",

    "| If you're looking for a fun and glitzy movie about the complications of juggling career and love, you should watch this. I didn't watch the first movie this is a sequel to and you don't need to to enjoy this. I grew up abroad, so hadn't heard of Debbie til recently, (Tiffany truly was more my neck of the woods - and if you've seen it then you know how one of the jokes rang true with me) but really this is good fun for the family. It continues the Hallmark tradition of wholesome movies, but not in a boring predictable way. I thought the actors had great chemistry, the writing was smart, fun & pacey, and the production values were remarkably good. Go on, treat yourself with a glass of wine, you won't regret it. | positive (0.9498) | <span style=\"color:green\">yes</span> |"
